        <h2>Life Story</h2>
        <p>I grew up as a part of a large family in Milwaukee, WI. As a kid I loved biking, skateboarding, and playing with Legos.
        As I got older, I became interested in computers and photography. I spent a lot of time with friends taking pictures and making band posters.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I was asked by friends to take photos for senior yearbooks, engagements, weddings, and more. This set me on a path of learning
        and developing my own photography business.</p>
        <p>Along the way I had the opportunity to volunteer with a number of charities overseas and at home. A mentor of mine taught me the basics of bookkeeping
          and accounting and trained me for a job with a non-profit that was near and dear to my heart. As a total nerd, I loved numbers, organizing & analyzing data,
          and working for a good cause.</p>
          <p>Today I am happily married, still photographing for many of my friends, enjoying life, and looking forward to what's next!</p>
